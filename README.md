This is a project done in python to express some basic concepts that have been 
learnt in the language.

It is a basic game that allows you to enter the number of times you want to game and 
allows you to make the guesses.

An error is thrown every time you make a wrong guess.
the system thus wins.

The program then calculates you final percentage score based on the attempts made.

Fun, Right?

Give it a try
